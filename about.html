            <p>Ms. Lucy, affectionatley named by the students she interacts with in her day job, is a Phoenix resident of 15 years by way of Durango, Mexico. Ms. Lucy's Flan comes from the love and joy she gets from cooking this delicious native Mexican treat. She began cooking them for holidays and special family occasions and slowly started cooking them by request and orders for friends and colleagues. As the word got around about how delicious her product is, more and more orders began to come in and "Flans de Ms. Lucy" was born.</p>
            <p>Although her specialty dish is Flan, Ms. Lucy is a great cook of her native country's cuisine and has been known to cook traditional holiday foods such as Tamales, Bunuelos, Menudo and more.</p>
